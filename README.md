## Project specifications
1. Create and migrate a User model with :username, :email and :password.
2. Add validations for presence to each field in the model.
3. Create the :users resource in your routes file so requests actually have somewhere to go. 
Use the :only option to specify just the :new and :create actions.
4. Build a new UsersController (either manually or via the $ rails generate controller Users generator).
5. Write empty methods for #new and #create in your UsersController.
6. Create your #new view in app/views/users/new.html.erb.
7. Create form in vanilla HTML 
8. Create form using form_tag   
9. Create form using form_for
10. Add edit view and its functionality
